<p style="text-align: justify;">
    I have extensive experience in overseeing electrical systems, maintaining industrial
    electrical equipment, and developing energy optimization solutions. With a strong
    foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of electrical engineering,
    my goal is to contribute to future research in the integration and optimization of
    sustainable energy systems.
