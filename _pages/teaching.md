<li> <strong> ECED 4602 Control Systems </strong> </li>
<p> Winter 2025 <p>
<p> <a href="https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&topicgroupid=39145&entitytype=CID&entitycode=ECED+4602ECED">ECED 4602 course</a> deals with control systems analysis and design aspects. Techniques for analyzing the performance of analog systems are introduced. Emphasis is on the use of the Laplace transform and state space techniques in evaluating system performance indicators including its stability. Tools introduced include frequency response methods, and the root locus. Practical examples involving design of controllers for small systems to achieve desired response are discussed.<p>

<li> <strong> ECED 3102 Electromechanics </strong> </li>
<p> Fall 2024 </p>
<p> This course <a href="https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&topicgroupid=37057&entitytype=CID&entitycode=ECED+3102">ECED 3102</a> covers the principles of electromechanical energy conversion and electric motors. A review of magnetic field behavior leads to magnetic circuit calculations and permanent magnet circuit behavior. Energy balance principles are used to develop force and torque relationships for many electromechanical applications including relays, meter movements and motor operation. Basic principles of motor operation such as rotating magnetic fields, efficiency and machine ratings are given as a prelude to an in depth presentation of AC and DC motor behavior. Emphasis is placed on motor control and application.</p>

<li> <strong> ECED 4421   Technology and Applications of Fiber Optics </strong> </li>
<p> Winter 2023 </p>
<p> This course <a href="https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&topicgroupid=39480&entitytype=CID&entitycode=ECED+4421">ECED 4421</a> deals with the basic principles and applications of optical fiber communications. Major topics include: ray theory and electromagnetic modes in optical fiber waveguides; step-index and graded-index multimode and single-mode fibers; transmission characteristics of optical fibers such as attenuation (absorption, scattering, bending), dispersion (multipath, waveguide, material, profile), and polarization (random, preserved); optical fiber communication systems (transmitter, receiver, digital and analog system design); advanced systems; non-communications applications.</p>

<li> <strong> ECED 4360   Antenna Theory & Design </strong> </li>
<p> Fall 2023 </p>
<p> This class <a href="https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&entitytype=CID&entitycode=ECED+4360">ECED 4360</a> is concerned with the basic theory and design of antennas. Major topics include: potential wave equations and solutions, the concept of retarded potentials, radiation from a current element and a half-wave antenna, fundamental parameters of antennas, impedance matching and methods of excitation, antenna arrays and signal processing antennas, induction and equivalence theorems, horn and slot antennas, antenna design and measurement.</p>

<li> <strong> ECED 3301   Electromagnetic Waves & Propagation </strong> </li>
<p> Summer 2016 </p>
<p> This course <a href="https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&entitytype=CID&entitycode=ECED+3301">ECED 3301</a> presents the basic theory and applications of propagation of electromagnetic waves. Major topics include: time-varying Maxwell's equations, electromotive force, electromagnetic spectrum, transmission of plane waves, reflection and refraction, polarization, radiation, transmission line theory, standing wave ratio, Smith Chart, impedance matching, guided wave structures, modes and cut-off frequencies.</p>
