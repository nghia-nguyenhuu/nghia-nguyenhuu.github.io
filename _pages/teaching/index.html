Techniques for analyzing the performance of analog systems are introduced. Emphasis is on the use of the Laplace transform and state space techniques in evaluating system performance indicators including its stability. Tools introduced include frequency response methods, and the root locus. Practical examples involving design of controllers for small systems to achieve desired response are discussed.</p> <p> </p> <li> <strong> ECED 3102 Electromechanics </strong> </li> <p> Fall 2024 </p> <p> This course <a href="https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;topicgroupid=37057&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=ECED+3102" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ECED 3102</a> covers the principles of electromechanical energy conversion and electric motors. A review of magnetic field behavior leads to magnetic circuit calculations and permanent magnet circuit behavior. Energy balance principles are used to develop force and torque relationships for many electromechanical applications including relays, meter movements and motor operation. Basic principles of motor operation such as rotating magnetic fields, efficiency and machine ratings are given as a prelude to an in depth presentation of AC and DC motor behavior. Emphasis is placed on motor control and application.</p> <li> <strong> ECED 4421 Technology and Applications of Fiber Optics </strong> </li> <p> Winter 2023 </p> <p> This course <a href="https://academiccalendar.dal.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;topicgroupid=39480&amp;entitytype=CID&amp;entitycode=ECED+4421" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ECED 4421</a> deals with the basic principles and applications of optical fiber communications.
