In my consulting work, I designed an advanced acoustic absorption system for a senior housing building, targeting a significant reduction in indoor noise levels. Prior to the installation, noise levels reached up to 80 dB, which could be uncomfortable for senior residents. With the new system, we achieved a substantial reduction, bringing the noise down to an acceptable and comfortable level around 60 dB, well within the standard allowance range. This improvement was warmly received by the residents, who noticed a much calmer and more serene environment.
