This project focuses on applying nanophotonics and metamaterials to improve underwater energy harvesting and sensing systems, such as triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). By using advanced nanophotonic structures, we aim to make these devices more efficient and versatile.

Our designs improve energy generation by increasing surface interactions and enhancing charge transfer in water. They also bring new features like light manipulation (e.g., absorption or scattering) to support environmental monitoring, biosensing, and underwater communication. With the help of metamaterials, we ensure these devices are durable, water-resistant, and suitable for challenging underwater conditions.

Applications:

1. <strong> Renewable Energy </strong>: Harvesting wave energy to power underwater devices.
2. <strong> Environmental Monitoring </strong>: Tracking water quality, temperature, and pollution.
3. <strong> Underwater Communication </strong>: Enhancing light-based data transmission.
4. <strong> Marine Biosensing </strong>: Detecting biochemical changes for ocean conservation.

This project combines advanced nanophotonics with practical applications, aiming to create innovative solutions for energy and environmental challenges in marine systems.
