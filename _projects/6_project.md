Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with various leading companies to develop innovative products inspired by nanophotonics and metamaterials. These experiences allowed me to contribute to the design, simulation, and implementation of cutting-edge solutions in energy, safety, and lighting. By working with industry leaders, I gained valuable insights into transforming research into real-world applications.

The project highlights the following advancements, which are already available in markets and are currently being further developed by our group:

<strong>Laser-Filtering Eyewear</strong> – Participating in the creation of holographic coatings for eyewear that safely reflect harmful laser beams, enhancing safety in high-tech environments.
<strong>Nanostructured LED Coatings</strong> – Engaging in the design of thin-film coatings for LEDs to improve brightness and energy efficiency, transforming lighting solutions.
