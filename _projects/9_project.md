The Vietnamese School Society in Halifax (VSH), a non-profit founded and managed voluntarily by Dr. Nghia Nguyen-Huu and licensed by Access Nova Scotia, aims to teach Vietnamese language and culture to children of Vietnamese families and others interested in learning. With support from Faith City Church, the school staff, and advisors, VSH provides language classes, tutoring in subjects like Math, Physics, and programming, along with fun activities like art and chess clubs. The school also organizes cultural events, such as Lunar New Year celebrations, BBQs, and camping trips, to connect families and help children embrace their Vietnamese heritage in Nova Scotia.
