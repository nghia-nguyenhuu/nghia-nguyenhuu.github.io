My research focuses on advancing the design and development of optical filters
and polarizers for high-performance displays and sensing technologies. By
utilizing subwavelength metallic gratings (SWMGs) and resonant
waveguide-metallic gratings (RWMGs), I have created integrated devices capable
of performing color filtering and polarization simultaneously. These innovative
approaches significantly enhance the efficiency and functionality of modern
screens and photonic systems.

In my paper, “Realization of integrated polarizer and color filters based on
subwavelength metallic gratings using a hybrid numerical scheme,” we
demonstrated high transmission efficiency with multi-layer SWMG designs.
Key findings include:

<li> A single-layer grating that effectively combined polarization and color
filtering for LCD applications, achieving up to 50% transmission efficiency at
RGB wavelengths (see Figure 1).</li>

<li> A double-layer grating that improved filtering performance, reaching
approximately 60 dB for polarizing effects, making it ideal for compact,
integrated devices (see Figure 2).</li>

Another publication, “Color filters featuring high transmission efficiency
and broad bandwidth based on resonant waveguide-metallic grating,” explored
RWMG structures to achieve broader spectral bandwidths and higher efficiency
for advanced displays and imaging systems. Highlights include:

A double-layer RWMG with silver gratings, optimized to achieve transmission
efficiencies of up to 82% for red and 66% for blue, with a wide bandwidth of
125 nm, making it suitable for high-definition displays
(see Figure 3 in the publication).
A triple-layer RWMG, which further enhanced transmission efficiency and
bandwidth, enabling precise color control (illustrated in Figure 4).

These findings demonstrate the potential of nanophotonic structures to
revolutionize consumer electronics and optical communication systems, setting a
new benchmark in color filtering and polarization technologies.
