My research in nanophotonics and metamaterials focuses on controlling light at the nanoscale by combining graphene with advanced structures like gratings and layered designs. These innovations create exciting opportunities in energy, sensing, and photonics by enabling the tuning of light properties for many applications.

One important achievement in my work is a graphene-covered metallic grating that achieves 98% absorptance in the near-infrared spectrum. This is a big improvement compared to graphene’s natural 2.3% absorptance (see Figure 1). The design combines graphene’s unique properties with resonant modes in the grating, making it useful for ultrafast photodetectors, thermal management, and optical communication while working well across wide incident angles.

I also developed dual broadband infrared absorbers that use magnetic polaritons to achieve very high absorption at two infrared wavelengths (see Figure 2). These absorbers are useful for infrared detection, thermal imaging, and chemical sensing, where sensitivity and working at multiple wavelengths are needed. Another part of my research is optimizing subwavelength aluminum gratings to create strong and tunable absorption peaks with wide spectral widths (see Figure 3). These designs are ideal for energy harvesting, infrared sensing, and thermal management. This shows how computational tools like genetic algorithms can help improve optical designs.

I also worked on double-layered metallic gratings that can fine-tune their optical transmission by adjusting the air gap between the layers (see Figure 4). These designs are very effective for proximity sensors, optical filters, and photonic devices in the visible and near-infrared range. They are also simple and cost-effective, which makes them great for real-world applications.

These studies show how integrating graphene with nanostructures can achieve amazing control over light and its properties. From improving light absorption to precisely tuning the spectrum, my work demonstrates the potential of nanophotonics and metamaterials for solving modern challenges and creating new innovations.
