<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>
I'm excited to invite you to our <strong>first-ever IEEE information session at CBU</strong>!  
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the world’s leading organization for engineers, innovators, and technology enthusiasts — and now we are bringing these opportunities right to our campus.
</p>

<p>
Whether you're interested in networking, building real engineering skills, boosting your résumé, or joining competitions and professional activities, IEEE can open doors for you.
