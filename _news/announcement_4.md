Good news! I am excited to share that Iâ€™ve accepted a full-time Engineering Instructor position at Cape Breton University. I'm so happy to contribute to the next generation of engineering staff, drawing from my industry, research and teaching experiences and looking forward to this new chapter. Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this wonderful journey!
